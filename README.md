- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dadatoa
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things but currently more about webdesign
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop and deploy static website with a static site builder. I believe static websites can do a lot of thingd, are easy to develop and deploy. My current project is made with Jekyll, next one should be a test to do same with Hugo.
